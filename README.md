# Image-Classifier-using-TensorFlow


A Python based application which classifies images according to their respective fonts using Tensorflow library. Here we have to classify the  given images to 4 given fonts.  We reduce the pixel values within 0-1, for simpler calculations. We employ one-hot encoding for the labels. We divide the dataset into training and test data. A Tensorflow graph is created X is placeholder for the features and Y is the placeholder for the labels, the weights are randomly initialized as well as the bias. Softmax activation function is used for the network.
